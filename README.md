# Timestamp Texts
Add a timestamp to all sent and received text messages with a variety of configuration options. Compatible with Mod Manager - Phone App or edit /UserData/TimestampMono.cfg [or _Il2Cpp.cfg]. Requires Melon Loader.

Configure sent and received timestamps separately:
* Custom size (or use default)
* Custom color (or use default)
* Use Italics
* [Brackets]
* Show before or after message body
* Show inline or new line
* Optionally display the day name as the first received message in each conversation daily
* Can also add the "date" (total day count in save) to day name

This mod is open source under the MIT license.

The Timestamp-custom.dll in this repo has a small side function to trigger an incoming text from all 3 suppliers when you press F5. This is just to help if you had your messages cleared (e.g. from a broken mod) and don't have a way to order from suppliers.
