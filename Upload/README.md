## Reference
### Source Code
- [Github Repository](https://github.com/GuysWeForgotDre/TimestampTests/) -- This mod is open source under the `MIT license`. I encourage you to learn from it and / or use it in your own creations.
  - *Note: The `Timestamp-custom.dll` in this repo has a function to trigger an incoming text from all 3 suppliers when you press *`F5`*. This is a fix for messages cleared (e.g. from a broken mod) to order from suppliers. It remains on 1.0.0 and is only needed for that function.*
